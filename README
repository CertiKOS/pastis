       PASTA - Polynomial Amortized Size Tracking Analysis
       ===================================================

- Build Instructions

Pasta comes with its rarely installed dependencies.  To build it
you will still need to have the following core:

  * GMP 4.2 or up
  * MPFR 2.2 or up
  * OCaml 4.0 or up
  * A C99 compiler (gcc/clang)
  * A C++ compiler (g++/clang++)

The location of most of these dependencies can be specified using
the main configure script, see ./configure --help for details.
